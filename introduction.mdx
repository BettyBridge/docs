BR-DGE helps you streamline your payment processes by providing a single unified orchestration abstraction. BR-DGE will act as a central bridge for managing payments, and allow you to connect with multiple Payment Service Providers (PSPs). 

You, as a merchant, will be able to use APIs to interact with different PSPs. Some examples of how you would use this are:
* To make sure a payment succeeds, if a payment does not succeed with one PSP, you can then redirect to the next PSP. 
* To make sure your payments take the more beneficial route, some PSPs are more favourable for different currencies or risk levels based on the industry or payment size.
* To make sure your company supports all schemes.
* To support tokenization, including network tokenization.
* To support 3-D Secure.
