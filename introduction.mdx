BR-DGE helps you streamline your payment processes by providing a single unified orchestration abstraction. BR-DGE will act as a central bridge for managing payments, and allow you to connect with multiple Payment Service Providers (PSPs). 

You, as a merchant, will be able to use APIs to interact with different PSPs. Some examples of how you would use this are:
* To make sure a payment succeeds, if a payment does not succeed with one PSP, you can then redirect to the next PSP. 
* To make sure your payments take the more beneficial route, some PSPs are more favourable for different currencies or risk levels based on the industry or payment size.
* To make sure your company supports all schemes.
* To support tokenization, including network tokenization.
* To support 3-D Secure.


## REST API 

The BR-DGE REST API provides a standardised way for you to communicate with PSPs via BR-DGE. You can use the OpenAPI interface to set up these various integrations:

## Web SDK

The BR-DGE Web SDK helps you gather payment data from your customers' browsers, for use in payments on your server. You can embed fields into your site which, when set up and used by your customers, will call the relevant BR-DGE APIs. The configuration of these are primarily in javascript and will need some technical skill to implement.

For more information, see Web SDK documentation.

## Hosted Payment Page
The BR-DGE Hosted Payment Page will redirect your customers completely to our own hosted page. BR-DGE captures and sends the payments, then redirects the customer back to your page when successful. 

For more information, see Hosted Payment Page documentation.

## Vault
The BR-DGE Vault saves card details for the future. This allows your customers to not re-enter card details and also increases approval rates.

For more information, see Vault documentation.

## Portal

The BR-DGE Portal is an interface where you can configure your payments. The Portal allows you to:
* Route your payments 
* Leverage payment reports
