description: 'The main payment flows used by BR-DGE.'
---

Payments using BR-DGE can be grouped into the following main flows. **All**
payment flows involve the use of your **Server API Key** to ensure there are no
unauthorized payments.

Alternatively, you can fully outsource your payment page to BR-DGE using our
customizable [Hosted Payment Page](BHPP), which has its own flow.

### Tokenized Payment Flow

Fully outsource all your cardholder data functions to BR-DGE so that your
platform qualifies for the simplest [SAQ-A PCI Compliance Form][pci-dss saq]
level. In addition to cards, this flow also supports many digital wallet payment
instruments such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal.

1. Your server sends a [Client API Key][authorization] to your client (1).
2. BR-DGE [PCI-DSS SAQ-D][pci-dss saq] compliant [Web SDK] and systems collect
   payment data and generate tokens that can be safely handled by your [PCI-DSS
   SAQ-A][pci-dss saq] platform.
3. Your client sends the payment token to your server, along with checkout
   information (3).
4. Your server creates payments using tokenized [Payment Instruments] (4), which
   routes the request to an appropriate [PSP][psp].

#### Tokenized Payment Flow with MOTO

Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments require merchant agents (e.g. call
centre staff) to handle cardholder data, meaning it is not possible to achieve
[PCI-DSS SAQ-A][pci-dss saq]. However, it is still possible to increase security
while decreasing compliance costs by tokenizing cardholder data on your agents'
client applications with BR-DGE via our [Web SDK] or
[Payment Instrument Tokenization Endpoints](/api-reference#/Payment%20Instrument%20Tokenization).
The rest of your systems can then only deal with less sensitive tokens.

<Note>

You will need a dedicated MOTO-only retail channel for processing MOTO
transactions.

### 3-D Secure Payment Flow

If [3-D Secure] is applied to a payment then some actions may need to be
performed on your client. These actions differ between individual [PSP]s, but
this flow works with [Web SDK] to abstract away differences so that you only
need to deal with one flow.

1. Your server receives a [3-D Secure additional action required] in response to
   a payment request.
2. Your server passes the action payload to your client.
3. The BR-DGE [Web SDK] provides functionality to handle the action, producing a
   nonce that you pass back to your server.
4. The nonce can be used to complete the payment using a
   `ProviderThreeDSecureNonce` [Payment Instrument][payment instruments].
   - You may receive additional [3-D Secure additional action required]
     responses depending on the underlying PSP, in which case return to step 1.

Please refer to the
[`Payment with ProviderThreeDSecureNonce` example payment request](/api-reference#/Payments/createPaymentUsingPOST)
for more details on the `ProviderThreeDSecureNonce` Payment Instrument.

### Redirect Payment Flow

<img height="200" src="/images/redirect-payment-flow.svg" />

Some [Payment Instruments] use a Redirect Payment Flow and require the customer
to be redirected to an external provider.

1. Your server sends a [Client API Key][authorization] to your client
2. The [BR-DGE Web SDK][web sdk] will intelligently offer appropriate payment
   options to your customers
3. If your customer selects a redirect flow payment option then your client app
   informs your server along with checkout information
4. Your server makes a payment request, and a URL redirect action is returned
5. You pass the URL redirect action to the [BR-DGE Web SDK][web sdk] running on
   your client app
6. The [BR-DGE Web SDK][web sdk] will redirect your customer to the URL of the
   external provider
7. Once your customer has finished interacting with the external provider then
   they will be directed back to your client app
8. Your client app confirms the outcome of the payment via your server
9. Your server confirms the outcome of the payment via BR-DGE

<Note>

Some [Payment Service Providers][payment service provider] may have a delay when
updating the payment status

</Note>

### Card Payment Flow

Your server creates a payment containing cardholder data via the [BR-DGE REST
API] (2), which routes the request to an appropriate [Payment Service Provider
(PSP)][psp].

<Alert>

By directly handling cardholder data, your platform will normally not qualify
for the simplest PCI-DSS SAQ level.
